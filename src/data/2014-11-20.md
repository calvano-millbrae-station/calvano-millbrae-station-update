About 6,000 people pass through the Millbrae Caltrain and BART station each day, making it the largest intermodal terminal west of the Mississippi River. At the Millbrae station, planes, trains and automobiles whir by all day with San Francisco International Airport and Highway 101 next door. But no one really stops to look around because there's not much to see. The station's economic potential is stalling on the tracks for the 22,000-person city that has floundered financially.
